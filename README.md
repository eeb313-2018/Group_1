# Introduction to Project

Using the mammalian life history data set we will investigate life history tradeoffs with respect to theory of senescence. Specifically we will examine if resource tradeoffs differ between life stages. We expect to see that there is negative correlation between resource allocation to reproduction in our mammals and resource allocation somatic maintenance (Life Expectancy) indicating that there is a tradeoff. This study is important as it allows us to infer whether there are trends with respect to different genera and mammals allow for potential to infer into human systems. This is interesting becasue of the the fact that mammals invest higher into offspring than other groups.

# Description of Data

The purpose of this dataset was to compile general life history characteristics for a variety of mammalian species to perform comparative life history analyses among different taxa and different body size groups. Life History data were pulled from several literature sources. The variables in our data set are: Maximum life span (months), Age of First Reproduction (months), Gestation time (months), Weaning age (months), Weaning Mass (grams), Litter size (months), litters per year, new born mass (grams), and adult body mass (grams). All variables are relevent for our analysis. We will use variables as proxies for resource allocation towards reproduction and to the soma.
