Potential Hypotheses

	- Litter size vs. litter frequency (larger litter size expected less frequent litters produced per year)
		○ carnivora and primates
	- Age at first reproduction vs average life span 
		○ carnivora and primates
	- Weaning mass and litters per year
		○ Negative
		○ Rodents, primates, carnivora
	- Litters per year vs life span 
		○ Longer you live less litters per year 
	- Newborn mass vs age at first reproduction
		○ Longer you wait bigger your offspring will be (Seen in all three)
	- Weaning mass - newborn mass (how much food/resources mother gave) vs maximum life span or avg age at reproduction

Orders to compare
	- Rodentia, primates, lagomorpha
