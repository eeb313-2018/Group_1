# Possible analyses
- May need to scale any time values as a fraction of total life expectancy, or any weights as a fraction of adult body mass.
- Group by order
- Possibly use a multiple regression analysis - see how traits indicative of investment into reproduction predict traits indicative of somatic investment
- Could run several regressions to group relevant reproductive traits (e.g. mammailian-only traits, traits associated with gestational investment, traits associated with post-birth investment, etc)

# Possible results tables
- Likely will not use a table for visualization; see below

# Possible results figures
- Scatter plots with regression lines showing relationships between reproductive traits and somatic traits
